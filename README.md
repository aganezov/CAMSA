=====

``CAMSA``  - is a tool for **C**omparative **A**nalysis and **M**erging of **S**caffold **A**ssemblies.

``CAMSA`` is developed using Python 3.5+ programming language and requires Python 3.5+ interpreter to work properly.

To install ``CAMSA``: download the repository snapshot from the master branch, install all the python packages required for CAMSA work (listed in requirements.txt).
We suggest using a ``virtual environment`` of python, to isolate the installation.

    python3.5 -m venv camsa_env
    source camsa_env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

``CAMSA`` usage instructions can be found by running:
